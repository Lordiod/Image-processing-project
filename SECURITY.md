## Security Best Practices

When using the Image Editor:

### For Users
- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
- **Trusted Sources**: Only download from official repositories
- **File Safety**: Be cautious when opening images from untrusted sources

## Known Security Considerations

### User Interface
- **File Dialogs**: Standard OS file dialogs are used for security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing
- **Error Messages**: No sensitive system information is displayed

## Dependencies Security

We monitor our dependencies for security vulnerabilities:

- **Pillow**: Regularly updated for security patches
- **CustomTkinter**: Modern, actively maintained UI framework
- **ScreenInfo**: Minimal, well-reviewed library
